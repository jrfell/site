Hello!

I'm Jey, a cyclist, knitter, gardener, camper, sewist, outdoors enthusiast, general enthusiast, and occasional data analyst. This site is a perpetual work in progress where I squirrel away my side projects.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at [jrfellzel\@gmail.com](mailto:jrfellzel@gmail.com){.email}
